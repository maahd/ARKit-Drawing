# ARKit-Drawing

This app utilizes Apple's ARKit framework to give the user an augmented reality experience. You can recognize images and detect multiple planes. If some planes extend to meet into a single plane, the app joins them into one. Furthermore, you can place one or more objects on the planes detected or images recognized. These objects can be shapes or 3D images preloaded into the app.
